# Deep-Learning-Project-Age-Estimation-Guided-Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-AIFR
This repository contains the Pytorch implementation of the paper Age Estimation Guided Convolutional Neural Network for Age Invariant Face Recogntion, Tianyue Zheng, Weihong Deng, Jiani Hu , CVPR , 2017
The folder contains the implementation for both datasets.

# Requirements 
1. PyTorch 0.4.1
2. Numpy
3. Sklearn

# Datasets  
1. MORPH Dataset
2. CACD Dataset
Both datasets are publicly available. Kindly download and preprocess the datasets before training the model.

# Training 
For training the model kindly use the following command
```python main.py```
